A stop for all links in the classroom

## Why the switch?

We switched to GitHub because Weebly was too restrictive. It had no support for copyleft, and had a pay-to-stay free motto, meaning you had to pay to remove branding. Weebly didn't make the content. It made the styles. However, those styles couldn't be changed **at all.** So we switched. We paid less. And we got more. Isn't it funny how you pay more to get less, and pay less to get more? I thought so. But others can have their own opinions. Well, that's enough of me talking. Let's finish this readme.
